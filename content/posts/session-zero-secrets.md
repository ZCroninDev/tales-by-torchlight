# Session Zero Secrets: Things Most Groups Forget to Cover

Session zero is your campaign's safety net. It is where you align expectations, surface deal-breakers, and decide how the story should feel before dice ever hit the table. Most groups cover the basics—tone, schedule, maybe a quick rules refresher—but plenty of critical questions get skipped because they feel awkward or "obvious." Here are seven topics I always revisit to make sure the campaign starts with buy-in from everyone at the table.

## 1. Spotlight Balance and Story Cadence

How long does each player feel comfortable being out of the spotlight? Does anyone need the DM to check in more often to confirm they are engaged? Clarifying the rhythm ahead of time helps you notice when someone is drifting into spectator mode. Write down a rotation list or introduce quick "scene breaks" to keep moments shared.

## 2. Lines, Veils, and the "Pause Button"

Instead of a quick nod to safety tools, define concrete examples of lines (hard stops) and veils (fade-to-black moments). Agree on what the table says or does when someone needs to pause play. Whether it is an X-card, tapping the table, or a short verbal cue like "scene shift," rehearse it now so nobody freezes later.

## 3. Table Tech and Distractions

Phones, tablets, and laptops can be helpful references—or bottomless attention drains. Decide how devices should be used during play, when it is okay to look up rules, and how you will share digital character sheets or battle maps. If someone needs a device for accessibility, make that clear so nobody misreads it as disengagement.

## 4. Downtime and Between-Session Logistics

Players love when the world keeps moving between sessions, but only if expectations are set. Map out how you want to handle downtime requests, shopping, or crafting. Will you use a shared document, Discord thread, or email recap? Agree on turnaround times so nobody feels pressured or ignored.

## 5. Advancement Preferences

Leveling can be milestone-based, experience-based, or hybrid. Beyond the mechanics, ask what pace feels satisfying for the group. Do players enjoy leveling together, or is staggered progression acceptable? Clarify how magical items, boons, or multiclassing approvals will work to head off frustration later.

## 6. Conflict at the Table vs. In Character

Character conflict can be juicy drama, but only if everyone can separate fiction from real feelings. Discuss what kinds of intra-party tension are on the table, and how players should check in with one another before escalating a scene. Adopt an easy preface like "My character wants to argue, are you cool with that?" to keep emotions steady.

## 7. Exit Strategy and Campaign Wrap

Life happens—jobs change, schedules break, or interest fades. Build an exit plan that honors everyone's time. Decide how much notice you want if someone needs to leave, how their character will exit, and whether the remaining group wants to fold in new players. Planning for the end at the beginning keeps the story from collapsing when real life intrudes.

### Quick Checklist to Capture Decisions

- Campaign tone, inspiration, and safety lines/veils  
- Attendance policy, tardiness grace period, and digital tools  
- Advancement method and milestone cadence  
- How downtime, loot division, and recap notes are shared  
- Conflict cues, PvP limits, and character death expectations  
- Procedure for adding or removing players mid-campaign  
- The signal anyone can use to pause, breathe, and reset

Treat session zero like worldbuilding. The clearer you are now, the easier it becomes to improvise later without stepping on anyone's fun. Make these conversations part of your campaign ritual and you'll head into session one with a party that trusts each other and a DM who knows exactly how to guide the adventure.
